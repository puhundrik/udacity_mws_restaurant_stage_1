# Frontend Nanodegree Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview

This is the project for Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Course.

The goal of this project is to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. We take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. We also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for our users. 

## How to Install

Get the project files:

* Clone the [repository](https://github.com/puhundrik/udacity_feedreader_testing.git) to local PC.

or

* Download [zip-file](https://github.com/puhundrik/udacity_feedreader_testing/archive/master.zip) with repository, unpack the files to any folder

#### If you do not have local web-server

1. In the folder with project, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

#### If you have local web-server
1. Put the project files to your web-server document root.
2. Visit the site `http://localhost`.
